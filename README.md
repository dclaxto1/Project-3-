# Project-3-
### Requirements
​
For Project 3, I had to work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements we had to fulfill:
​
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
​
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
​
    * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
​
    * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
​
    * A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (**must be approved**)
​
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
​
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
​
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
​
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
